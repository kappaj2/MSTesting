First process is to get JHipsterRegistry running.
Clone from the GIT repo at => https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry

$ git clone https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry reg

Run the registry with
1. ./mvnw
2. yarn start
This will start with dev profile by default
Now package it ready for prod
$ ./mvnw -Pprod package
The executable can now be run with dev or prod profiles
$ ./target/jhipster-registry-<version>.war --spring.profiles.active=prod

$ ./target/jhipster-registry-3.2.4.war --spring.profiles.active=dev


Make directory for all the different micro-services components
cd root of application stack
$ cd ms1
$ jhipster => select the default options for a microservice application
  each ms app will run with it's own java package => za.co.ajk.ms1

The port config as follows:
Gateway -> This runs on the standard 8080 port
ms1 -> 8081 -> we start from 8081 and work upwards for each micro service
ms2 -> 8082
ms3 -> 8083
ms4 -> 8084
reg -> 8761
